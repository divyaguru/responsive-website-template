# responsive-website-template
This template provides a base that helps in building a responsive website instead of beginning from scratch. This has been modified to suit my WebDev projects so feel free to alter it according to your use-case.

<h2> Changes Implemented in this Template </h2>
  1. Converted the "side" element into a sidebar. \n
  2. Merged "side" (now sidebar) with the "navbar" into a single component. \n
  3. Added responsiveness to the sidebar -> changes into a hamburger button for smaller screen sizes.
  4. Added a feature to add a brand logo in the top-navbar that would fit within the max-height .
